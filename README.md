# YouTube Channel Archiver
A simple Java project to archive YouTube channels, developed during my first year learning Java. 
Although I have a few years of programming experience, please note that the code quality might not be the best, 
as this project was to explore 3rd party java libraries and get a feel for the language. Feel free to contribute and help improve the codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Java JDK](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) (version 11 or higher is required).
* You have a recent version of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed (version 3.6.0 or higher is recommended).
* You have read the [License](LICENSE) terms for using this project.

This project also uses python for one of the optional functions, although the related function hasn't been fully implimented, it is recommended to install python and ensure that it is on path.

All the required dependencies are managed by Maven and listed in the `pom.xml` file. Maven will automatically download and manage these dependencies when you build the project.
